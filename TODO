need examples

these haven't been done yet (going from the reference doc indices):

libbonobo, libbonoboui:
	not touched.  should it go in a separate module?  (still in this
	namespace, but...)

libgnome:
	gnome-exec (perl offers the same features natively)
	gnome-config (the docs say it's not for mainstream apps)
	gnome-triggers (failed to implement this one)

libgnomeui:
	gnome-ui-init (the parameters... the gnome_init stuff is deprecated)
	GnomeIconLookup
	GnomeThemeFile (no GObject, so I'll wait till someone begs for it)
	gnome-stock-icons (not all are deprecated)
	gnome-vfs-util (no bindings for gnome-vfs, either!)
