Overview of changes in Gnome2 0.93
==================================

* Changed the binding of gnome_popup_menu_append from Gtk2::Menu::append to
  Gtk2::Menu::append_from.  This is API breakage.  Any existing application
  using Gtk2::Menu::append and expecting to get gnome_popup_menu_append needs
  to be changed.
* Added new GnomePasswordDialog methods.
* Switched to the new version information policy introduced by Glib and Gtk2.
* Made minor bug fixes and improvements.
* In accordance with the GNOME Bindings release plan, Gnome2 froze API.
